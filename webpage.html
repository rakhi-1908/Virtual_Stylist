                <h1>To determine your body type, you can follow this simple guide:</h1>
                Step 1: Take Key Measurements
                Use a flexible measuring tape and follow these steps:
                
                1. Shoulders: 
                   - Measure the widest part of your shoulders by wrapping the tape all the way around. This is easier with assistance.
                
                2. Bust: 
                   - Measure around the fullest part of your bust, ensuring the tape is level across your back and chest.
                
                3. Waist: 
                   - Find the narrowest part of your waist, typically just above your belly button, and measure around it.
                
                4. Hips: 
                   - Measure around the fullest part of your hips and buttocks.
                
                Step 2: Compare Your Measurements
                Write down your measurements and compare them to each other:
                - Is one area significantly larger than the others?
                - Are they all relatively similar in size?
                - Does your waist stand out as noticeably smaller?
                
                Step 3: Identify Your Body Type
                Hereâ€™s how to match your proportions to a body type:
                
                1. **Rectangle**:
                   - Shoulders, bust, and hips are roughly the same size.
                   - Little to no definition in the waist.
                
                2. **Hourglass**:
                   - Bust and hips are nearly the same size, with a significantly smaller waist.
                   - This shape often has a balanced and curvy appearance.
                
                3. **Triangle (Pear)**:
                   - Hips are wider than both your shoulders and bust.
                   - Your upper body is narrower compared to your lower body.
                
                4. **Inverted Triangle**:
                   - Shoulders or bust are noticeably broader than your hips.
                   - Your upper body is more prominent than your lower body.
                
                5. **Apple (Round)**:
                   - Your waist is less defined and may be as wide or wider than your bust and hips.
                   - You may have a fuller midsection.
